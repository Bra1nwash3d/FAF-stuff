effects class (has id, name, stack_id) and inbuilt timer with feedback (register in some sorted queue)
dict in chatentity to hold via stack_id, recalc multipliers whenever effects change

new point types for GAME, ROULETTE, POKER etc, they may even stack!

maybe:
eventsbase with IOBtree? maybe more efficient, gotta test some time
